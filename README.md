# Destini

A life Time like app called Destini. The app prompts user with a scenario and the user has two options to choose from and each 
choice brings them to a different scenario and eventually an ending. At the end of the story, whichever ending the user comes 
to, a restart button appears that takes the user back to the opening story when pressed. I followed video tutorials from the 
London app brewery through Udemy to create this.
